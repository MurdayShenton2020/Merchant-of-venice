But though much remains clear, who today can make full or en- tirely comfortable sense of it? In this very fully annotated edition, I therefore present this passage, not in the bare form quoted above, but thoroughly supported by bottom-of-the-page notes:</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;"><i>Duke </i>Meantime the court shall hear Belario’s letter: (<i>reading aloud </i>)<span class="s17">1 </span>“Your Grace shall understand, that at the receipt of your letter I am<span class="s17">2 </span>very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor<span class="s17">3 </span>of Rome, his name is Balthasar.

Some readers, to be sure, will be able to comprehend unusual, his- torically different meanings without any glosses.Those not famil- iar with the modern meaning of particular words will easily ﬁnd clear, simple deﬁnitions in any modern dictionary. But most read- ers are not likely to understand Shakespeare’s intended meaning, absent such glosses as I here offer.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">My annotation practices have followed the same principles used in <i>The Annotated Milton, </i>published in 1999, and in my anno- tated editions of <i>Hamlet, </i>published (as the initial volume in this series) in 2003, <i>Romeo and Juliet </i>(published in 2004), and subse- quent volumes in this series. Classroom experience has validated these editions. Classes of mixed upper-level undergraduates and graduate students have more quickly and thoroughly transcended language barriers than ever before. This allows the teacher, or a general reader without a teacher, to move more promptly and conﬁdently to the nonlinguistic matters that have made Shake- speare and Milton great and important poets.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is the inevitable forces of linguistic change, operant in all liv-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11 putting to the proof, testing (“performance”)</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12 declare</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">ing tongues, which have inevitably created such wide degrees of obstacles to ready comprehension—not only sharply different meanings, but subtle, partial shifts in meaning that allow us to think we understand when, alas, we do not. Speakers of related languages like Dutch and German also experience this shifting of the linguistic ground. Like early Modern English (ca. 1600) and the Modern English now current, those languages are too close for those who know only one language, and not the other, to be readily able always to recognize what they correctly understand and what they do not. When, for example, a speaker of Dutch says, “Men kofer is kapot,” a speaker of German will know that something belonging to the Dutchman is broken (“kapot” <span class="s20">= </span>“kaputt” in German, and “men” <span class="s20">= </span>“mein”). But without more linguistic awareness than the average person is apt to have, the German speaker will not identify “kofer” (“trunk” in Dutch) with “Körper”—a modern German word meaning “physique, build, body.”The closest word to “kofer” in modern German, in- deed, is “Scrankkoffer,” which is too large a leap for ready com- prehension. Speakers of different Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian), and all other related but not identical tongues, all experience these difﬁculties, as well as the difﬁculty of under- standing a text written in their own language ﬁve, or six, or seven hundred years earlier. Shakespeare’s English is not yet so old that it requires, like many historical texts in French and German, or like Old English texts—for example, <i>Beowulf </i>—a modern trans- lation. Much poetry evaporates in translation: language is im- mensely particular. The sheer <i>sound </i>of Dante in thirteenth- century Italian is profoundly worth preserving. So too is the sound of Shakespeare.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I have annotated prosody (metrics) only when it seemed</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">truly necessary or particularly helpful. Readers should have no problem with the silent “e” in past participles (loved, returned, missed). Except in the few instances where modern usage syllab- iﬁes the “e,” whenever an “e” in Shakespeare is <i>not </i>silent, it is marked “è.”The notation used for prosody, which is also used in the explanation of Elizabethan pronunciation, follows the ex- tremely simple form of my <i>From Stress to Stress:An Autobiography of English Prosody </i>(see “Further Reading,” near the end of this book). Syllables with metrical stress are capitalized; all other sylla- bles are in lowercase letters. I have managed to employ normal- ized Elizabethan spellings, in most indications of pronunciation, but I have sometimes been obliged to deviate, in the higher inter- est of being understood.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">I have annotated, as well, a limited number of such other mat- ters, sometimes of interpretation, sometimes of general or histor- ical relevance, as have seemed to me seriously worthy of inclu- sion.These annotations have been most carefully restricted: this is not intended to be a book of literary commentary. It is for that reason that the glossing of metaphors has been severely restricted. There is almost literally no end to discussion and/or analysis of metaphor, especially in Shakespeare.To yield to temptation might well be to double or triple the size of this book—and would also change it from a historically oriented language guide to a work of an unsteadily mixed nature. In the process, I believe, neither lan- guage nor literature would be well or clearly served.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Where it seemed useful, and not obstructive of important tex- tual matters, I have modernized spelling, including capitalization. Spelling is not on the whole a basic issue, but punctuation and lineation must be given high respect.The Quarto uses few excla- mation marks or semicolons, which is to be sure a matter of the</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">conventions of a very different era. Still, our modern preferences cannot be lightly substituted for what is, after a fashion, the closest thing to a Shakespeare manuscript we are likely ever to have. We do not know whether these particular seventeenth-century printers, like most of that time, were responsible for question marks, commas, periods, and, especially, all-purpose colons, or whether these particular printers tried to follow their handwrit- ten sources. Nor do we know if those sources, or what part thereof, might have been in Shakespeare’s own hand. But in spite of these equivocations and uncertainties, it remains true that, to a very considerable extent, punctuation tends to result from just how the mind responsible for that punctuating <i>hears </i>the text. And twenty-ﬁrst-century minds have no business, in such mat- ters, overruling seventeenth-century ones.Whoever the compos- itors were, they were more or less Shakespeare’s contemporaries, and we are not.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: right;">Accordingly, when the original printed text uses a comma, we are being signaled that <i>they </i>(whoever “they” were) heard the text, not coming to a syntactic stop, but continuing to some later stop- ping point.To replace commas with editorial periods is thus risky and on the whole an undesirable practice.(The dramatic action of a tragedy, to be sure, may require us, for twenty-ﬁrst-century read- ers, to highlight what four-hundred-year-old punctuation stan- dards may not make clear—and may even, at times, misrepresent.)</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">When the printed text has a colon, what we are being signaled is that <i>they </i>heard a syntactic stop—though not necessarily or even usually the particular kind of syntactic stop we associate, today, with the colon. It is therefore inappropriate to substitute editorial commas for original colons. It is also inappropriate to employ ed- itorial colons when <i>their </i>syntactic usage of colons does not match</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">ours. In general, the closest thing to <i>their </i>syntactic sense of the colon is our (and their) period.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: right;">The printed interrogation (question) marks, too, merit ex- tremely respectful handling. In particular, editorial exclamation marks should very rarely be substituted for interrogation marks. It follows from these considerations that the movement and sometimes the meaning of what we must take to be Shakespeare’s play will at times be different, depending on whose punctuation we follow, <i>theirs </i>or our own. I have tried, here, to use the printed seventeenth-century text as a guide to both <i>hearing </i>and <i>under-</i></p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">standing <span class="p">what Shakespeare wrote.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Since the original printed texts (there not being, as there never are for Shakespeare, any surviving manuscripts) are frequently careless as well as self-contradictory, I have been relatively free with the wording of stage directions—and in some cases have added brief directions, to indicate who is speaking to whom. I have made no emendations; I have necessarily been obliged to make choices. Textual decisions have been annotated when the differences between or among the original printed texts seem ei- ther marked or of unusual interest.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">In the interests of compactness and brevity, I have employed in my annotations (as consistently as I am able) a number of stylistic and typographical devices:</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="p">The annotation of a single word does not repeat that word</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">• <span class="p">The annotation of more than one word repeats the words being annotated, which are followed by an equals sign and then by the annotation; the footnote number in the text is placed after the last of the words being annotated</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="p">In annotations of a single word, alternative meanings are</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">usually separated by commas; if there are distinctly different ranges of meaning, the annotations are separated by arabic numerals inside parentheses—(1), (2), and so on; in more complexly worded annotations, alternative meanings expressed by a single word are linked by a forward slash,</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or solidus: /</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">• <span class="p">Explanations of textual meaning are not in parentheses; comments about textual meaning are</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">• <span class="p">Except for proper nouns, the word at the beginning of all annotations is in lower case</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">• <span class="p">Uncertainties are followed by a question mark, set in parentheses: (?)</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">• <span class="p">When particularly relevant,“translations” into twenty-ﬁrst- century English have been added, in parentheses</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;"><span class="s20">• </span>Annotations of repeated words are <i>not </i>repeated.
