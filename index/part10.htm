People attracted to the theater tended to be both extremely verbal and extremely volatile.Actors were sometimes attacked, when the audience was dissatisﬁed; quarrels and ﬁghts were relatively common.Women were regularly in attendance, though no reliable statistics exist.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">• <span class="p">Drama did not have the cultural esteem it has in our time, and plays were not regularly printed.
