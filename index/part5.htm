This quarto-sized book, which has become the basic text for all</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">modern editions, also gives us, directly and immediately via the volume’s title page, a good idea of what the printer-publisher thought was most worthy of public attention. “The most excel- lent history of the Merchant of Venice, with the extreme cruelty of Shylock the Jew towards the said merchant, in cutting a just pound of his ﬂesh, and the obtaining of Portia by the choice of three chests.” <span class="s17">1 </span>The Quarto text is so clean that scholars think it was quite probably printed directly from Shakespeare’s manu- script.Whether or not Shakespeare had anything to do with the title page (most likely he did not), the description of the play fo- cuses on three plot lines: ﬁrst, Antonio the merchant of Venice; second, Shylock, the rapacious, almost ﬁendish Jewish money- lender; and third, the courting—by an odd sort of lottery-like procedure—and winning of Portia, a singularly wealthy young heiress. Note that the most intensely dramatic portion of the de- scription is that concerning Shylock, who has often been mistak-</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">enly thought of as the “merchant” of the play’s title.The writer of the title page plainly saw Shylock’s part of the narrative as the play’s best selling aspect.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">As is so often the case with Shakespeare, many elements of the story are borrowed, in this case principally from <i>Il Pecorone </i>(“The Blockhead”), a collection of stories published in Florence in 1558 and not at that time translated into English. It has been argued, sensibly and on the basis of the totality of Shakespeare’s work, that he could read Italian.The details of the original tale are of some interest, but will not be here discussed: what is most relevant to readers of this edition is how Shakespeare presents material from all his sources, and thus how it seems most accurately and usefully to read his play as we have it.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">The Merchant of Venice <span class="p">comes early in what might be called Shakespeare’s “middle” period, shortly after </span>Romeo and Juliet <span class="p">and </span>A Midsummer Night’s Dream <span class="p">and just before </span>Henry the Fourth, Part One. <span class="p">The play features a good deal of the “low” comedy to be seen in </span>The Taming of the Shrew, <span class="p">which dates from roughly four years earlier.There is also, in the more “serious” parts of the play (those in verse rather than in prose), some of the most beautifully worked-out passages Shakespeare ever wrote:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your mind is tossing on the ocean,</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">There where your argosies with portly sail Like signiors and rich burghers on the ﬂood, Or as it were the pageants of the sea,</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do overpeer the petty trafﬁckers</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As they ﬂy by them with their woven wings.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 252pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(1.1.7 – 13)</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Spoken by one the minor characters, Salarino, about the mer- chant Antonio, these seven lines are composed of a single tightly woven sea-metaphor.The passage traces Antonio’s state of mind, subtly employing the nature of his profession to give us two trains of thought at the same time: the preoccupations of Antonio’s mind, and the preoccupations of his business.The passage is also a bold proclamation of the poet-playwright’s superb literary mas- tery.We do not need to know who or what Shakespeare was, nor do we need to understand every one of these lines in detail, to realize that we have here been launched on a tautly controlled literary-dramatic expedition.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">But just as there are necessary limitations to our ability to un- derstand all of Shakespeare’s <i>words, </i>so too there are broader as- pects of the play that are historically conditioned and not fully comprehensible without explanation. In matters of religious be- lief, even matters of knowledge, <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>must be approached, today, with caution. We know little about Shake- speare’s life (though more than enough to have no doubt that he wrote his plays). We know virtually nothing about his likes and dislikes, or (though he may sometimes seem to know everything knowable) the true extent of his knowledge. He must have en- joyed success, or he would hardly have worked so intensely at achieving it. He used his money to buy land, and to purchase a coat of arms. But who does not enjoy success? Who in a land- dominated culture does not value its ownership? Who in a ﬁercely status-conscious society does not desire a degree of status?</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">We must be particularly careful not to lean on a tremendously effective and enormously popular comic drama, trying to place it in an ideological schema—like that which we have come to call anti-Semitism—in which it has little if any legitimate place.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Shakespeare surely shared much of the experience common to most Elizabethans. But though incredibly gifted, he remains no more than human. Most of the people he knew were Christian, and he had to know a good deal about that faith. Did he know any Muslims, and what did he know about Islam? There is a total lack of evidence. But did he know any Jews, and what did he know about Judaism? The play plainly seems to be deeply con- cerned with both Jews and Judaism; Shylock and his daughter are major players in the plot. But what is the true role and importance of their stated religious identity? How much are either Jews or Ju- daism the play’s concerns?</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;"><i>The Merchant of Venice </i>is dramatic ﬁction, and ﬁction is by def- inition pretense: the writer tries (and Shakespeare brilliantly suc- ceeds) in making us believe in his ﬁction.The writer (and even more, the good writer) rarely has much interest in persuading us that his ﬁction is fact. No matter how devoted he or she may be to a cause or to a belief system, it is the ﬁction that matters the most—to the writer as to us.When we learn that in fact, despite an ancient expulsion of the Jews, “there were Jews in Shake- speare’s England,” what have we learned about Shakespeare’s play? When we are told, further, that the number of such Jews was “probably never more than a couple of hundred at any given time,” have we any useful information about either Shakespeare or his play? <span class="s17">2 </span>On the other hand, knowing that “a villainous Jew- ish usurer was being portrayed on the London stage some twenty years before <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>was written” seems decidedly relevant, for this helps us understand the background from which the play emerged.<span class="s17">3 </span>Similarly, it is useful to know that “England’s fascination with the conversion of the Jews had begun in earnest</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;">in the late 1570s and early 1580s and was quite well established by the time that Shakespeare wrote <i>The Merchant of Venice.</i>” <span class="s17">4</span></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: right;">James Shapiro, who has made a thorough study of the matter, explains that “the word <i>Jew </i>had entered into the English vocabu- lary in the thirteenth century as a catchall term of abuse.” Noting “such stock epithets as ‘I hate thee as I do a Jew,’‘I would not have done so to a Jew,’ and ‘None but a Jew would have done so,’” he concludes that “the Jew as irredeemable alien and the Jew as bo- geyman . . . coexisted at deep linguistic and psychological lev- els.”<span class="s17">5 </span>As John Gross puts the matter, “Nothing can alter the fact that, seen through the eyes of the other characters, Shylock is a deeply threatening ﬁgure, and that the threat he poses is of a pe- culiarly primitive kind.” <span class="s17">6 </span>We need to add that what “the eyes of the other characters” truly means, here, is “Elizabethan England,” the citizens of which were of course the intended and the actual audience of the play (and the readers of its Quarto publication). We also need to understand that Elizabethan England had only relatively recently been caught up in the Renaissance transforma- tion of European economies. We know that, unlike Mediter- ranean economies,“there were no private moneychangers in me- dieval London” and that, although “from the ﬁfteenth century onwards London goldsmiths were beginning to engage in deposit banking,” no such effective system was in place in England until the end of the seventeenth century.<span class="s17">7 </span>Thus, Europe’s long record of hostility to money lending, and the interest charged thereon, had been largely dissipated in countries like Italy but lingered in countries like England.“By the end of the sixteenth century, . . . Jews were increasingly identiﬁed [in England] not with usury per se, but with outrageous and exploitative lending for proﬁt.” <span class="s17">8 </span>In-</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: justify;">deed, “Shakespeare’s ‘alien’ Shylock cannot really be understood independent of the larger social tensions generated by aliens and their economic practices in London in the mid-1590s.” <span class="s17">9 </span>It is in no way surprising that “most moneylenders in Elizabethan litera- ture were thoroughly sadistic.” <span class="s17">10</span></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Accordingly, if we ask, as Martin D.Yaffe does, how “are we meant to understand Shylock’s Jewishness,” the answer seems rea- sonably clear. <span class="s17">11 </span>Despite the power of Shylock’s two speeches of protest, the nature of his Jewishness is both vague and elusive. Per- haps, for our purposes, today, it ought to be considered largely symbolic. Shakespeare’s compatriots did not want or need more than that. It is therefore completely appropriate for that symbolic representation to say, as Shylock does at the approach of Antonio, “I hate him for he is a Christian” (1.3.36). It is equally appropri- ate for Shylock’s daughter to say to Gobbo,the clown who is leav- ing Shylock’s employ in order to be with a good Christian em- ployer, “I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so. / Our house is hell, and thou a merry divel / Did’st rob it of some taste of te- diousness” (2.3.1 – 3). Or for her to say, on the same subject,“But though I am a daughter to his [Shylock’s] blood, / I am not to his manners” (2.3.7 – 8). Similarly, Lorenzo, Jessica’s Christian lover and future husband, can declare with the absolute conﬁdence of anyone who confronts a mere totem, “If e’er the Jew her father come to heaven, / It will be for his gentle daughter’s sake” (2.4.34 – 35).</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">In short,“Shylock’s stage-Judaism is a pseudo-religion, a fabri- cation: there is no true piety in it, and nothing to hold him back as he pursues his revenge.” <span class="s17">12 </span>We can no more go to <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>for perspectives on, or information about Jews and Ju- daism, than we can go <i>Hamlet </i>for guidance on Renaissance Dan-</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">ish manners and mores, or to <i>Anthony and Cleopatra </i>to help us un- derstand Egypt during the great years of Rome. This is not to deprecate any of these splendid dramas, for no one in their right mind would or should approach Shakespeare’s plays on non- English subjects in this way.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Still, <i>The Merchant of Venice </i>being a great play by the greatest of playwrights, the situation is inevitably somewhat more complex. Shakespeare’s mind is so quick, his heart has so many deep and broad chambers, that he cannot simply sketch out his major ﬁg- ures as cartoon characters. He is as it were obliged to engage them as human beings. In the ﬁrst of Shylock’s two magniﬁcently hu- manizing speeches, he speaks to Antonio, in the course of loan negotiations:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Signior Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my monies and my usances.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Still have I borne it with a patient shrug (For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe). You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog,</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And spit upon my Jewish gabardine,</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">And all for use of that which is mine own. Well then, it now appears you need my help. Go to then, you come to me, and you say Shylock, we would have monies, you say so. You that did void your rheum upon my beard, And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Over your threshold, monies is your suit. What should I say to you? Should I not say, Hath a dog money? Is it possible</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">A cur should lend three thousand ducats? Or Shall I bend low, and in a bondman’s key</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">With bated breath, and whispering humbleness, Say this: Fair sir, you spat on me on Wednesday last, You spurned me such a day, another time</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">You called me dog, and for these courtesies I’ll lend you thus much monies?</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">(1.3.100 –122)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Shakespeare is not, in this speech, entering into any of the eco- nomic and religious issues that have been touched upon, albeit lightly, in this introductory essay. He is simply engaging, on levels few can reach, with a character in pain. He does this with Shylock on one more occasion, this time in prose rather than in verse:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. (3.1.49 –57)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Shakespeare’s intention in both these deservedly famous pas- sages is not to justify Shylock’s ﬁerce cruelty. He is straightfor- wardly depicting a character, in the depth that he as a writer needed to attain.What he has achieved is in a sense a natural by- product of his genius rather than anything intrinsic to some gen- eral view of Jews and Jewishness, which is to some degree the</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: right;">nominal subject matter of his play. And Shylock’s piercing hu- manity, as thus achieved, does not affect that nominal subject mat- ter, any more than it does the narrative course of the play. Shylock is silenced and punished (both ﬁscally and by being compelled to accept baptism as a Christian) according to then-prevailing views of the fundamental nonhumanity of Jews and Jewishness. Is there a contradiction between the human Shylock and these attacks on what is obviously considered the nonhuman nature of Jews and Jewishness? Of course there is—if we attempt to frame <i>The Mer- chant of Venice </i>as an ideological drama, even an exposition of how Shakespeare himself viewed Jews and Jewishness.The play was no more conceived in such terms than <i>The Taming of the Shrew </i>was meant as a savage assault on women or than <i>The Tempest </i>was in- tended to be a close critique of magic or the behavior of magicians. Recall the description of the play on the Quarto’s 1600 title page. Antonio is clearly one of its three focal points, and he is a major player. But Shakespeare does little more with him than make him, as he makes Shylock, what the American novelist Henry James liked to call a <i>ﬁcelle: </i>a stage device, used to pull plot strings.When he is required to be melancholy, he is melancholy, and when that need has passed, he ceases to be melancholy. When he is called upon to be somewhat unusually fond of Bassanio— though not so unusually fond as might appear in our twenty-ﬁrst century, for there is absolutely nothing sexual in his part—Anto- nio ascends to the occasion. He can be loyal, he can be long- suffering—everything that he needs to be and, aside from the characteristic Shakespearean elegance with which he speaks, not a great deal more.Antonio works quite satisfactorily, in a role thus delimited; his characterization will not bear any large, close ex- amination. For example, when he tells us, after the fact, why he thinks Shylock hates him, he claims circumstances never previ-</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">ously mentioned and not fully consistent with what has been told us:“He seeks my life, his reason well I know. / I oft delivered from his forfeitures / Many that have at times made moan to me, / Therefore he hates me” (3.3.21 – 24). The abusive episodes that Shylock has described are not here recalled. Neither is Antonio’s bland statement, after Shylock’s biting recitation,“I am as like to call thee so again, / To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too” (1.3.123 – 124). These are obviously not issues relevant to Anto- nio’s <i>ﬁcelle</i>-like status.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">But the third and last-named of <i>Merchant</i>’s three centers of attention, Portia, has an immense part in the play’s comedy of courtship and, ﬁnally, its light and witty romanticism—which oc- cupies the whole of the ﬁfth and last act. In act 1, scene 2, Portia is the very model of maidenly wisdom and, as to the other sex, cyn- icism.“I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching” (14 – 16). More directly, she asks her lady in waiting, Nerissa,“I may neither choose whom I would, nor refuse whom I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?” (20 – 24). By the end of the scene, having rather scorchingly reviewed some of the many candidates for her hand, she sighs over yet another would-be husband: “If I could bid the ﬁfth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint, and the com- plexion of a divel, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come Nerissa. Sirrah go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door” (113 – 119).</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">She doggedly deals with, and is rid of, a number of failed suit- ors—until suddenly, there is an unknown and unnamed one an-</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">nounced by a messenger—that is, a servant. Portia’s witty com- ments to the messenger, as she makes his break off his praise of this unknown, exhibit a new excitement:“No more, I pray thee. I am half afeared / Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee, / Thou spend’st such high-day wit in praising him” (2.9.96 – 98). The Elizabethan audience would have had no trouble understanding that the relative of a messenger would have no business courting a high-upper-class woman who consorts on equal terms with princes.This swift ﬁllip, stirring up the courtship plot, is genially and very effectively tossed off.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">In act 3, scene 2 we see Portia in a more sobered state.The un- known suitor has been the one she most wanted, Bassanio, and he is impatient to take the test that will either win her or lose her.“I would detain you here some month or two,” she tells him,“Before you venture for me” (9–10). Plainly, she wants to be with him but not to risk being unable to be with him any longer, if he fails the test. She does not think he will fail it. But just the same, she is cau- tious. And he, male and impetuous (as well as ﬁscally desperate, a condition her immense wealth would instantly cure), wants to move ahead as quickly as possible. As he steps through the casket maze, sweet music is played, and sung, creating a perfect atmo- sphere for romantic success. Portia sees it coming, for she knows which choice would be the right one, and speaks in an aside of her maidenly wish not to hurry this wonderful thing to its death:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">O love, be moderate, allay thy ecstasy,</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">In measure rein thy joy, scant this excess. I feel too much thy blessing, make it less, For fear I surfeit.</p><p style="padding-left: 264pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(112 – 115)</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">He prevails—and makes the right choice, she is his. In a dazed, happy confusion he tells her he is “doubtful whether what I see be true, / Until conﬁrmed, signed, ratiﬁed by you” (148 – 149). Portia speaks with a wisdom ripening right before our eyes:</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand, Such as I am.Though for myself alone</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better, yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself,</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times More rich, that only to stand high in your account I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends, Exceed account. But the full sum of me</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Is sum of something – which to term in gross, Is an unlessoned girl, unschooled, unpracticed, Happy in this, she is not yet so old</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">But she may learn, happier than this, She is not bred so dull but she can learn.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">(150 – 163)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">The glow of an exceedingly good marriage to come is all over her words. This is in the best sense comedy—that is, drama with a happy ending.Act 5 will extend this most beautifully.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">But before Portia and Bassanio can reach that point, the dan- ger Antonio is in, because of Shylock’s ﬁerce malice, must be dealt with. Bassanio rushes off to help. Portia, already wiser than he is in the real ways of the world, takes an indirect but distinctly more functional route.Knowing Antonio’s is a case in law,being tried in court, she obtains from a learnèd cousin the best legal advice available—and also the appropriate legal robes, for she proposes</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">to handle the case herself, in court.Armed and efﬁcient, she sails into court, where the chief judge is the Duke of Venice himself.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Duke <span class="p">Came you from old Belario?</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Portia <span class="p">I did my lord.</span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Duke <span class="p">You are welcome, take your place.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Are you acquainted with the difference</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That holds this present question in the court?</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Portia <span class="p">I am informed thoroughly of the cause.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew?</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 249pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(4.1.166 – 171)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Portia’s disguise is complete and so effective that her husband (they have been married but their marriage has not yet been con- summated) does not recognize her. Her masterly aplomb, indeed, is utterly lawyer-like. In fact, when she has ended the case in a completely satisfactory way (satisfactory, that is, to her side, which is of course the play’s good side), she turns to the clerk of court and directs,“Clerk, draw a deed of gift” (4.1.391). It is a total tri- umph, and yet another blow in Shakespeare’s continuing en- deavor to prove that, all other things being equal, women tend to signiﬁcantly overmatch the men they deal with.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Act 5 opens with one of the other two pairs of happy lovers, Lorenzo and Jessica (Shylock’s daughter), sitting in the garden of Portia’s magniﬁcent house. It is night; the setting is replete with the stigmata of romance:</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Lorenzo <span class="p">The moon shines bright. In such a night as this, When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees</span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">And they did make no noise, in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls,</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressed lay that night.</p><p style="padding-left: 256pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(5.1.1 – 6)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Lorenzo and his new-wedded wife, Jessica (escaped from a Jewish “hell” into a haven of Christianized happiness), prettily toss back and forth a deft mixture of blossoms and barbs. Lorenzo again ro- manticizes, once again to the sort of sweet music that earlier ac- companied Bassanio’s choosing among the three caskets:</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank. Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears. Soft stillness, and the night, Become the touches of sweet harmony.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sit Jessica, look how the ﬂoor of heaven</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Is thick inlayed with patens of bright gold. There’s not the smallest orb which thou beholdst But in his motion like an angel sings,</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Still choiring to the young-eyed cherubins. Such harmony is in immortal souls,</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close in it, we cannot hear it</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">(53 – 64)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Portia and Nerissa (whose unconsummated marriage to Gratiano constitutes them the third wedding pair) arrive. Portia’s ﬁrst words strongly reinforce the tenor of act 5 thus far:</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Portia <span class="p">That light we see is burning in my hall. How far that little candle throws his beams. So shines a good deed in a naughty world.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">(88 – 90)</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">But Shakespeare is far too accomplished a dramatist to end the play simply with ﬂowers and moonshine.There follows a lovely barrage of teasing banter, in the course of which both Portia and Nerissa show, yet again, how vastly their husbands are over- matched by them.The men are reduced to submissive admissions of guilt and pledges for a guilt-free future:</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bassanio <span class="p">Nay, but hear me.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I never more will break an oath with thee.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">(246 – 248)</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">The play is thus all but ﬁnished. In a very few more lines, Portia leads them all indoors, for what is indicated will be a set of most acceptable tripartite acts of marital consummation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part6.htm">Notes</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part4.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../index.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part6.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
